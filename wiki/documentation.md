Here you will find articles on each of Picket's features and the various syntax for each.

## Tutorials

Please note that a tutorial series is in the making and will be available soon. This will be the simplest way to learn Picket. For now, these documentation articles serve as the best way to learn, although you will need some knowledge of object-orientated programming.

## Contributing

Like everything else, if you find any issues with the documentation, please let me know. Currently, the best way to do that is by creating a GitHub issue.
