Your contribution is thoroughly appreciated and there is a number of ways, large and small, of doing so. Currently, the community is very small so all help is hugely valuable. If you feel you can assist, I am keen to hear from you at pete@stuffaboutpete.com.

## Using the code

The simplest thing you can do to help is try Picket and let us know how you get on. When you try writing some code, file any bugs you find on GitHub. If you have no problems, we want to hear about that too.

## Developing Picket

At the other end of the scale, you can contribute to the core. Currently the most sensible way to go forward with this would be to contact me whilst we develop a thorough road map. Be assured there are plenty of plans in the works including performance improvements, enums, generics and much more. If you want to simply make changes, create a branch off `develop` and create a pull request.

## Sharing

The other way you can help is to tell your friends and colleagues. Or write about us, whether your opinion is positive or negative (although consider talking to us first if it may help). We know that any coverage we get will help us attract a vibrant community.
